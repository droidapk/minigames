</center>
<p>
  The cost of a phone is an important factor for many consumers. Android phones offer a wider range of prices than iPhones, making them more accessible to a wider range of consumers. This is because there are many different manufacturers of Android phones, and each manufacturer offers a range of models at different price points.
</p>
<p>
  For example, you can buy a budget-friendly Android phone for around $100, while a high-end Android phone can cost over $1,000. This gives consumers a lot of flexibility in choosing a phone that fits their budget and needs.
</p>
<p>
  In contrast, iPhones are only manufactured by Apple, and Apple's phones are generally more expensive than Android phones. The cheapest iPhone currently available is the iPhone SE, which costs $399. The most expensive iPhone currently available is the iPhone 14 Pro Max, which costs $1,099.
</p>
<p>
  This difference in price is a major reason why Android phones are more popular than iPhones. Android phones offer a wider range of prices and features, making them more accessible to a wider range of consumers.
